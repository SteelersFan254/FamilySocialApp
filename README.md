# Getting Started

When the program is run the user is directed to the login page with an input field for email and password and a Sign Up + Login button in the navigation bar. If the user tries to access another page or component without a successful login they will be redirected to the login page. With a successful login, the user is directed to the Home page, displaying information entered on the Sign Up page on the left. In the middle the Event feed is displayed with an input box at the top meant for users to post upcoming events for others to know about. On the right an Announcement feed is displayed with an input box at the top that's meant for users to post simple announcements / statements

# User Story

As a member of a large family I want to be able to post and view only other family members post, so that I have peace of mind making announcements or event post

# Business Context

Considering most mainstream social media applications (with standard settings, and not being configured otherwise manually most of the time) leave your profile's data open to be gathered by anybody on the internet, along with the chance of your personal info being sold, traditional social media platforms can be unattractive. Leave your worries at the sign-up page never having to fear that your data will be compromised using the StayTogether app today!
